# Qbert Game

This is a C++ implementation of the classic Qbert game. The game is built using the **ICbytes** library, providing a platform to manage various functionalities like graphics, input handling, and more. The game includes several core features such as animations, sound effects, and player interaction.

## Features

- **Character Animations**: Moving animations for the main character, Qbert, as well as turning and jumping effects.
- **Enemy Movements**: Includes enemy snake-like movements with animations.
- **Sound Effects**: Background music, character sounds, enemy sounds, and game events (e.g., victory, intro, game over).
- **Highscore Tracking**: A highscore system to track the best player performances.
- **Game States**: Includes different states such as pause, game over, and victory states.
- **Player Interaction**: Controls for Qbert, including movement and jumping.
- **Block Interactions**: Block movements and animations with collision handling.
- **Multithreading**: Utilizes threads for managing different parts of the game such as enemy movements and sound systems.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash

- **Objective**: Complete the game by jumping on all the blocks while avoiding the enemies.

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys** / **WASD**: Move Qbert.
- **Space Bar**: Jump to the next block.
